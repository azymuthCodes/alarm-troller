# alarm-troller

A fun and simple app that i developed when i had nothing to do in my life.I dont know why i created it,blame my friend for planting the idea in my head.It's an alarm app that if you click the alarm button it randomly sets an alarm at a random date and time only to suprise you at that specific moment with no way of turning it off(because i forgot to add notifications) once it rings.

Made using Flutter
